# RoundTimer


 ### Status: On progress.
 
React Native app that will provide the user a timer to help him control the length of martial arts/combat sports' sparrings/fights.

The objective is to make the user experience as simple as it can be but also giving the user the posibility to customize it to enhace it.

It will have three predefined timers with different rounds and break lengths that can be edited for the user. Once a timer was edited it will give the user the choice to restore the predefined values.

# RoundTimer


 ### Status: On progress.
 
React Native app that will provide the user a timer to help him control the length of martial arts/combat sports' sparrings/fights.

The objective is to make the user experience as simple and intuitive as it can be.

It will have three predefined timers with different rounds and break lengths that can be edited for the user. Once a timer was edited it will give the user the choice to restore the predefined values.
